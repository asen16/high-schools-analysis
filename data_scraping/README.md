DATA SCRAPING
# Data Scraping Part
The Council of Higher Education shared various data about universities between 2018-2020. In the study, these data were scrapped and an analysis was made.

The program scrapes the data of students in a total of 10617 departments from 223 different universities.

Each department has 30 different datasheets. In this study, 3 datasheets were used to perform the necessary analyzes. Variables of other datasheets are shared at the end of the yok_data_scraper.py file for use in future studies.
